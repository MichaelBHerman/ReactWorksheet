#Worksheet with React js exercises.

Each exercise will require the creation of a new component. Each component file should be created
inside of a components folder within your exercise React project. Once the component is created,
instantiate the new component within the App.js component for testing.
Component Exercises
1. Create a DisplayName component that renders a person’s first name and last name to the web
page
a. Insert the Exercise 1 state object from the ComponentExercisesSeedData.txt file into
your App.js component.
b. Pass the first name and last name as props to the component you created to be
displayed as h1 tag in the web page.
2. Create a NamesList component that renders a list of names to the web page.
a. Insert the Exercise 2 state object from the ComponentExercisesSeedData.txt file into
your App.js component.
b. From the App.js component, pass the array of strings as props to the component you
created to be displayed in a list (use an <ol> or <ul> tag)
3. Create a AlertUser component that renders a button that says “Click Me”
a. When the button is clicked it will pop up an alert box that says “devCodeCamp”
b. IMPORTANT: the function that is responsible for the alert() must be defined in the
App.js component and passed as a prop to the AlertUser component, so that when the
button is clicked it triggers the function that is being passed as a prop.
4. Create a SuperheroTable component that renders a table of superheroes to the web page.
a. Insert the Exercise 4 state object from the ComponentExercisesSeedData.txt file into
